# Linux, Its Pros And Cons

* Open Source :- What is it like when you buy a car, You don't know how the car and its components work, Similarly it's the case when you use a Windows System. However, in contrast, Linux is an open-source project. This means that you can have a look at the source code of a Linux Kernel, I know, most people don't care about this openness of Linux, but to me, this is the most important feature of using Linux. Windows Might be a target to a lot of bugs and this is because of Windows Being a closed source OS but on the other side Linux's Code Might be available for everyone to see, even to hackers Linux Users are more secure because If 1 Hacker is scanning the code for bugs there might be 10 people searching for bugs to patch it as soon as possible, to find and solve the same Bug.
